We help companies manage both their fiat and crypto operations, stay compliant and achieve financial viability

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (with urls or IPFS file CIDs included) at following :

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

We help companies manage both their fiat and crypto operations, stay compliant and achieve financial viability.
We’ve built a full web3 business account for businesses that deal with both crypto and fiat incomes.
We provide secure multi chain custodial MPC wallets and dedicated multi currency IBANs (available in 2 months) so they can receive crypto and fiat payments easily. They don’t even need a bank account or a wallet infrastructure. Onboarding has been streamlinined to a 7 minute process.
The ability to dynamically tag & label transactions to have financial visibility over incomes and reconcile transactions easily for accounting purposes.
We allow easy crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat payouts.
We take care of invoicing, compliance and integration into traditional accounting softwares as well. It really feels like using a traditional neo bank, you almost don’t know you’re using crypto.
We partner on MPC with Fireblocks & Dfns, on IBANs with Modulr and on compliance/KYB with Elliptic, Comply Advatange and Ubble.
We’re working with merchants in both web2 and web3, some names include : Warner Music, LOSC Football Club, Ami Paris... We’ve raised 5.2m$ from Fabric and Viola and 20+ angels earlier this year.


### Ecosystem Fit 

Help us locate your project in the Crust landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

* What need(s) does your project meet?
We would like to get in touch with your ecosystem leads to see how we can integrate our solution / generate value for our respective users. 

* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the IPFS/Crust ecosystem? 
  * If so, how is your project different?
  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
Today there are no direct competitors but people can use software like multis or request finance to built on top of existing wallet infrastructures. Traditional banks or PSP providers can also decide to integrate a crypto payment service at some point.

What makes us different ?
We do multichain fund custody (Ethereum, Polygon, Tezos, IMX..); whereas others are built on top of a non-custodial mode like Gnosis
We do automated transaction characterization based on on-chain information and manual categorization; most software do manual categorization
We do crypto and fiat payouts to third parties; they allow you to off ramp to your account only or crypto payments
We have an integrable back-end financial API
We can automate transactions because of our API
We do transaction risk analysis with a compliance program and compliance reports for banks
We have a financial data extract report for your accountant that we will soon integrate into all accounting tools.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to IPFS/Crust. We *recommend* that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month. 

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone, and include the approximate number of days along with the cost per day.
* _Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory_ and shall not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
